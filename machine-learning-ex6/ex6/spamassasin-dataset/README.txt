OK, now onto the corpus description.  It's split into three parts, as follows:

  - spam: 500 spam messages, all received from non-spam-trap sources.

  - easy_ham: 2500 non-spam messages.  These are typically quite easy to
    differentiate from spam, since they frequently do not contain any spammish
    signatures (like HTML etc).

  - hard_ham: 250 non-spam messages which are closer in many respects to
    typical spam: use of HTML, unusual HTML markup, coloured text,
    "spammish-sounding" phrases etc.

  - easy_ham_2: 1400 non-spam messages.  A more recent addition to the set.

  - spam_2: 1397 spam messages.  Again, more recent.

Total count: 6047 messages, with about a 31% spam ratio.
